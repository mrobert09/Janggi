# Janggi
Portfolio project for CS162

This project was done as the capstone to CS162. It implements a version of Janggi, aka Korean Chess. There are a couple rules that were not implemented as per requirements for the course. Namely their is not draw mechanic or functionality of Generals looking seeing each other that would lead to the draw. Therefore the came will continue until someone wins.

There are some debug user interfaces that allow for a print out of board state. Users make moves by calling the Janggi games class method "make_move" that takes two arguments: The square where the piece is moving from and the square where the piece is moving to.
